# API Document

API docs, or API description documents, are the collection of references, tutorials, and examples that help developers use the APIs.

API’s documentation is the primary resource for explaining what is possible with APIs and how to get started. It also serves as a place for developers to return with questions about syntax or functionality.

# Types of API Documentation

Your API documentation will have several types of content. Some are meant to show what’s possible to a developer considering an integration. Others will get those developers started quickly. And yet, good & simple API documentation should remain useful when that developer is deep into their work.

Your documentation must completely describe the API’s functionality, be accurate, educational, and inspire usage. It’s a big job that can roughly be broken down into three types:

1. Reference and functionality
2. Guides and tutorials
3. Code samples and examples

## Reference and functionality

Reference documentation is the most important type of documentation. It describes the API’s resources and methods, parameters, and responses. It’s the most technical type of documentation and is usually written for developers who are already familiar with the API.
