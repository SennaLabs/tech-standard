# Requirement Document

## Introduction

Requirements documentation describes the business solution for a particular project, including the user's expectations and needs, the purpose behind that solution, and any high-level constraints that can affect successful deployment. It typically serves as the guideline for stakeholders to decide on project priorities, structure, and design to guarantee the project stays aligned with the business's overall goals. It also serves as a fundamental contract between the vendor and customer, outlining the project's deliverables and expectations. A requirement document sets the standards for determining when you have completed a project.

It allows you and the client to:

Plan predictable project timelines so you can plan accordingly
Define deliverables and develop only relevant functionality
Show hidden and assumed requirements
Get a deeper understanding of the future system or product

## The importance of documentation of requirements

Here are the main reasons documentation of requirements is important for many businesses:

### Explain projects to stakeholders

Most stakeholders want to share their opinions. They also typically want to feel reassured that their business analyst has understood their desires completely. The requirements document can offer you the opportunity to show how you plan to meet their needs, preventing any unwanted surprises later in the delivery process.

### Help organize priorities

Many assignments originate from an immediate business need. Preparing one project may involve consulting users, designing different processes, considering which systems to use, and preparing to meet deadlines. Having a business requirements document to work from can help you understand the most efficient way to complete these tasks by offering a clear list of goals and steps to take.

### Improve client communication

Documenting requirements can allow you and the client to:

1. Plan predictable project timelines so you can both strategize accordingly
2. Define deliverables and develop only relevant functionality
3. Show hidden and assumed requirements
4. Gain a deeper understanding of the future system or product

### Preserve data

It's important to have measures in place to assure the preservation of data as the project progresses and as team members change. There are many reasons team members may leave the project before it's complete. Recording your analyses as you work can help reassure the project owners that the information you've collected is still available even if you don't stay on the team.
