# Architectural Document

A software architecture document is a map of the software. We use it to see, at a glance, how the software is structured. It helps you understand the software’s modules and components without digging into the code. It’s a tool to communicate with others—developers and non-developers—about the software. It’s also a tool to help you understand the software yourself. Also describing the components and specifications required to support the solution and ensure that the specific business and technical requirements of the design are satisfied.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

## Scope

This document describes the architecture of the system. It provides a structured decomposition of the system into components and connectors, and maps the components onto code artifacts. It also describes the run-time processes that use and interact with the system, including user agents, other hardware devices, and other software systems. It describes the deployment of those run-time processes onto servers, including physical hardware and virtual machines. It describes the non-functional characteristics of the system, such as performance, scalability, availability, reliability, security, and maintainability.
