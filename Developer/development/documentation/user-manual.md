# Requirement Document

It is the description of how the software shall perform and which environment setup would be appropriate to have the best out of it. These are generated while the software is under development and is supplied to the tester groups too.

## Types of Requirement Document

1. **Functional Requirement Document (FRD)**: It is the description of how the software shall perform and which environment setup would be appropriate to have the best out of it. These are generated while the software is under development and is supplied to the tester groups too.
2. **Non-Functional Requirement Document (NFRD)**: It is the description of how the software shall perform and which environment setup would be appropriate to have the best out of it. These are generated while the software is under development and is supplied to the tester groups too.
3. **System Requirement Specification (SRS)**: It is the description of the software system to be developed. It is completely described in terms of functional and non-functional requirements. It serves as a contract between the developer and the customer for the software system.

## Functional Requirement Document (FRD)

Functional requirements specified in the document determine the intended behaviour of the system. The FRD lays out the system’s functionality in detail by describing that expected behaviour which may be realised as tasks, services, or functions. The document makes clear how the project team plans to satisfy the business need. The contents of the document explain the said business need, current and desired state, and functional requirements.

The FRD is independent of the solution. It doesn’t provide information on how the product will be developed, how it will work, or what it should be, but rather what the product should do. As such, the functional requirements commonly come in the form of requirements statements. The functional requirements document commonly includes a list of requirements statements organised by the feature with identified priorities.

This type of documentation is very important for the whole development as it presents a link between the business and technology sides of the process. It’s a point where stakeholders and technical teams meet and it further ensures cooperation between the two sides. The FRD reiterates the business needs by turning them into functional capabilities and features that need to be achieved by the product or system.

## Non-Functional Requirement Document (NFRD)

Non-functional requirements are the criteria that define the operation of a system. They are constraints on the design or implementation of the system. They can be considered as quality attributes of the system. Non-functional requirements are also known as quality attributes of a system. They are also known as the “ilities” of a system. For example, usability, reliability, maintainability, scalability, performance, etc.

## System Requirement Specification (SRS)

The SRS is a formal document that describes the system requirements of a product/system, or a component of a product/system. It is considered as a contract between the developer and the customer. The SRS lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user. The SRS also functions as a blueprint for completing a project with as little cost growth as possible. The SRS is often referred to as the “parent” document because all subsequent project management documents, such as design specifications, statements of work, software architecture specifications, testing and validation plans, and documentation plans, are related to it.
