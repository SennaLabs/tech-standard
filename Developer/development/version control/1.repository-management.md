# Repository Management

## Repository Naming Convention

Repositories should be named in a descriptive and concise manner. For example, a repository for a web application could be named `sennalabs-ui` or `sennalabs-api`.

## README.md

Create a comprehensive README file in Markdown format. This document should provide an overview of the project, instructions for installation and usage, and any other relevant information. It helps users and contributors understand the purpose of the project and how to get started.

## Documentation

Maintain proper project documentation. Document the project's architecture, APIs, dependencies, and any other important details. Use tools like [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), [README](https://readme.so/), or Markdown to generate documentation from code or write it directly in the repository.

_Example_: Create a directory called `docs` in the repository. Include Markdown files with names like `architecture.md`, `api.md`, and `dependencies.md` to provide detailed documentation about the project's architecture, APIs, and dependencies.

## Branching and Version Control

Use a defined branching strategy like Gitflow. Create feature branches for new development work and merge them into the main branch using pull requests. For example:

```
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature`
- Make changes, commit: `git commit -m "feat(my-new-feature): Add my new feature"`
- Push branch to remote: `git push origin feat/my-new-feature`
- Create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch
```

## Code Reviews and Collaboration

Establish guidelines for code reviews and encourage team members to review each other's code. Use pull requests and provide constructive feedback. For example:

```
- Create a pull request: `git pull-request`
- Review changes, leave comments
- Approve and merge pull request if the code meets the guidelines
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Define and document the CI/CD process for each repository. For example, use GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Run tests
              run: npm test

            - name: Build and Deploy
              run: |
                  npm run build
                  # Add deployment steps here
```

## Security Best Practices

Educate team members about security best practices. Use secure coding practices, regularly update dependencies, and monitor for vulnerabilities. Integrate code scanning tools and security checks into the development workflow.

## Access Control and Permissions

Clearly define and manage access control and permissions for repositories. Grant appropriate permissions based on roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update access rights to ensure data security.

## Maintenance and Archiving

Regularly review and maintain repositories. Archive or delete repositories that are no longer actively maintained or relevant.
