# Guidelines for merging

## Before merging to main branch

1. Always `rebase` or `merge` merging branch with main branch so your merging code is up-to-date and make sure there are no conflicted code with the main branch.

    Generally, `rebase` is preferred for this because it won't create extra commit like `merge`. Make it easier to track your commit. 
    If there are multiple dev working on feature branch you should use `merge` because `rebase` will diverged your commit from other dev that are working in the same branch. It will affect other people when they try to push the code.

2. Always request other dev to review your code before merge if possible. It's good for other dev that work on the same project know what's going to get merge into main branch. They can also help spotted code error that might affected the project in the future. 

    Unless there is an emergency fix or no other devs are avaliable. Always request someone to review your code. 

3. Make sure every checked is passed before merge. Most project will have some automated actions to check your code automatically (lint, rspec, etc..). You should not merge until you pass every check.

## Merging to main branch

There are 2 methods that's we commonly use

1. `Create merge commit`. This will add all commit from merging branch to main branch and add merge commit for it. All commit will stay the same as the branch that you merge from.

2. `Squash and merge`. This will combine all commits into one commit that will get merge to main branch.

    Github use `Create merge commit` as default. That might not be the best choice if you have multiple commit that use for fixing minor errors. It will all show up on the main branch. Make it harder to track commit that have your actual work. 

    On the other hand, `Squash and merge` can combine all of that commit into one. This will make main branch clean even though you merge multiple commits into main branch. 
    Be aware that all commits will get merge into one. So an action that focus on individual commit might not be possible after doing this (ex. try to cherry pick one commit that already got squash to other commit).

We're currently use `Squash and merge` on most projects to make main branch clean.
