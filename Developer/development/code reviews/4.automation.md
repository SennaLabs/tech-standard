# Automation

## CI/CD

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing **_automation_** into the stages of app development.

CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is an automation strategy meant to solve the challenges of merge conflicts between individual developers' code and separate code branches. CI introduces workflows to frequently compile code changes, build the application, and test the new version for bugs and errors. If it passes the testing suite, the updates are cleared for the next phase of the development process.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment takes the benefits of continuous delivery a step further: now, the code is automatically pushed to a repository and then deployed to production in the same process. This relieves a potential burden on the operations team to manually deploy new releases, which may be numerous depending on the pace of the development team.

### CI Steps

1. Build test
2. Lint test
3. Unit test
4. Integration test
5. Deploy to staging

CI Unit test script example for a Node.js app:

```yaml
name: Test
on: [push]
jobs:
    run-tests:
        name: Run tests
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: 16.19.0

            - name: Install modules
              run: yarn

            - name: Run tests
              run: |
                  export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=4096"
                  yarn test --passWithNoTests
```

###### CI Lint test script example for a Node.js app:

```yaml
name: Test
on: [push]
jobs:
    run-tests:
        name: Run tests
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                  node-version: 16.19.0

            - name: Install modules
              run: yarn

            - name: Run Lint
              run: yarn lint
```

### CD Steps

1. Deploy to production

###### CD deploy to GCP Cloud Run script example for a Python app:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
    push:
        branches: [develop]

jobs:
    build-and-deploy:
        name: Build and Deploy Image to Cloud Run
        runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
        env:
            SERVICE_NAME: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_NAME }}
            PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}

        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0
              with:
                  service_account_key: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
                  project_id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
                  export_default_credentials: true

            - name: Build Image
              run: |
                  docker build -t asia.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA .
            - name: Gcloud Authentication
              run: |
                  gcloud auth configure-docker -q
            - name: 'Remove all container'
              run: |
                  gcloud container images list-tags asia.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME  --format="get(digest)" --limit=1 --sort-by="timestamp"> tags && while read p; do gcloud container images delete "asia.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME@$p" --quiet --force-delete-tags; done < tags
            - name: Deploy Image to Container Registry
              run: |
                  docker push asia.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA
            - name: Deploy Cloud Run
              run: |
                  gcloud --quiet beta run deploy $SERVICE_NAME --image asia.gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$SERVICE_NAME:$GITHUB_SHA \
                  --platform managed \
                  --set-env-vars="SECRET_KEY=${{secrets.SECRET_KEY}},BASE_DB=${{secrets.BASE_DB}}" \
                  --allow-unauthenticated \
                  --cpu 2 \
                  --memory 4G \
                  --region asia-southeast1 \
                  --max-instances 5 \
                  --port 8080 \
                  --timeout 10m
```
