# Received Tickets
After received tickets from Project manager _(IM1)_. Ticket owners should start by defining the problem of each ticket and estimate time that took to finish each ticket _(IM2)_. This will help you understand the scope of each ticket and making sure you correctly do the work that required for each ticket.

To help with this, you can study the flowchart _(IM3)_ that avaliable in your project to planned out your action for each ticket. This will make sure our work won't get conflict with another ticket later.

# Working on each ticket
After identify what you have to do in the ticket you can start implementing it by writing code _(IM4)_.
 
Make sure you follow the best practices and standard for the programming langauge using for project and write unit test that cover the scope of the ticket (eg. Code should return expected result or error message). 
 
If you change the code that use on other file. Make sure that everything still working as intended by running unit code or test that affected code locally.

After you finish with the coding. Try your code locally to see if you got the result that you want or not and run unit test locally. Make sure every cases are passed with no failed. _(IM5, IM6)_


# Finishing the ticket
After you implement the code and got the final result that completed the ticket _(IM7)_. You can commit them to Github repository to merge them into the main branch. After this, you should document every changes you did to the ticket github or Slack channel. Make sure every developers in the project know the important change like New API, New Evironment Variables (.env) or other breaking change.
