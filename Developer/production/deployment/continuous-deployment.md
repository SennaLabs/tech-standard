# Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment is a strategy for software development and releases in which every code change is automatically run through a pipeline of tests and inspections before being pushed into production.

Continuous deployment eliminates the human safeguards against unproven code in live software. It should only be incorporated when the development and IT teams rigorously adhere to production-ready development practices and thorough testing as well as when they apply sophisticated, real-time monitoring and metrics in production to discover any issues with new software releases.

## Benefits of continuous deployment

1. **Expedited software delivery.** The most significant advantage of continuous development is that it expedites the execution of code changes by eliminating bottlenecks at each stage of the pipeline. The code is executed with minimal downtime, letting end users benefit from new features more quickly because there's no extended wait time of weeks or months for the next release cycle to complete.
2. **Quicker feedback.** More frequent application upgrades result in a shorter feedback loop with the customer. With continuous deployment, a developer or product manager only needs to wait a few minutes to monitor the impact of new changes on user behavior or engagement and modify accordingly. When client behavior indicates the need for a quick pivot or change in approach, the ability to release updates quickly is beneficial. It also aids in detecting issues and shortens the feedback loop for user-facing modifications.
3. **Reduced development risks.** Continuous deployment decreases development risks. When teams integrate consistently and frequently, they considerably reduce potential risks, since they always know the system's current status.
4. **Reduced manual processes.** Continuous deployment encourages engineers to automate as much of the software development and code release process as possible, including release testing. Automation lets developers push new releases more quickly and save time normally spent on manual processes.
5. **Enhanced collaboration.** Continuous deployment encourages teams to provide regular input so the product can be enhanced and improved through iteration.
